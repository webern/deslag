# GH-457 Tauri sidebar navigation spawns terminal windows on Windows

## What Happened

On Windows desktop builds, opening a workspace and switching sidebar views can cause multiple terminal windows to flash open.

The strongest local match is the Kanban/workspace navigation path: when the page mounts, the desktop Rust backend computes per-repository git status and file changes for every codebase in the workspace. Those git calls are background diagnostics and should not create visible console windows.

## Expected Behavior

Desktop background checks such as git status inspection and ACP warmup should run headlessly on Windows.

## Reproduction Context

- Environment: desktop / Tauri / Windows
- Trigger: add a project, then switch sidebar views in a workspace

## Why This Might Happen

- The Rust desktop backend shells out to `git` multiple times per repository when loading workspace codebase changes.
- Some Rust child processes already opt into `CREATE_NO_WINDOW`, but the git helpers used by workspace/sidebar data loading did not apply the same Windows behavior.
- ACP warmup also launches background package-manager commands and should follow the same hidden-window policy.

## Relevant Files

- `crates/routa-core/src/git.rs`
- `crates/routa-core/src/acp/warmup.rs`
- `crates/routa-server/src/api/codebases.rs`
- `src/app/workspace/[workspaceId]/kanban/kanban-page-client.tsx`

## Observations

- `GET /api/workspaces/{workspaceId}/codebases/changes` loads on the Kanban page and fans out into git status calls for each codebase.
- Packaged desktop mode defaults to the Rust backend, so the fix needs to be in the Rust command paths rather than only in Next.js routes.

## Resolution Update (2026-04-21)

- Verified the GitHub tracker `#457` is already closed; the remaining drift was in the local tracker metadata.
- `crates/routa-core/src/git.rs` already routes git subprocesses through `git_command()` / `git_tokio_command()` with `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` on Windows, covering the workspace/codebase change probes that fire during sidebar navigation.
- `crates/routa-core/src/acp/warmup.rs` already applies `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` to ACP package warmup commands.
- Added the same Windows hidden-window behavior to desktop background server startup in `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/lib.rs` for both local `npm run start:desktop:server` and embedded `node server.js` launch paths, so the desktop shell does not leave visible console windows as a fallback path.
- Verified with:
  - `cargo test -p routa-desktop --lib`
  - `entrix run --tier fast`
