## [Unreleased]

This development version matches HarfBuzz [v14.3.1](https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/releases/tag/14.3.1).

- Update the built-in Unicode data to 18.0. Add Jurchen, Proto-Cuneiform, and
  Seal script constants to the Rust and C APIs and route them through USE.
- Support hexadecimal OpenType language and script overrides in `x-hbot-`
  and `x-hbsc-` private-use subtags, such as `x-hbot-4d4f4e54` for `MONT`.
- Add a unified `Buffer` type, matching HarfBuzz's `hb_buffer_t`. It carries a
  `BufferContentType` describing whether it holds input characters or shaped
  glyphs, and is shaped in place with `Buffer::shape`. `UnicodeBuffer` and
  `GlyphBuffer` are unchanged, and convert to and from `Buffer`.
- `Buffer::shape` returns `Result<(), ShapeError>`, reporting a buffer that
  already holds glyphs, a buffer with no direction, a font with nothing to
  shape with, and a plan built for other properties. Running out of room is
  reported through `Buffer::allocation_successful`, as before.
- Add the `harfrust_capi` crate, a C API mirroring the shaping half of
  HarfBuzz's API with an `hr_` prefix in place of `hb_`.

## [0.13.3] - 2026-08-25

This release matches HarfBuzz [v14.3.1](https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/releases/tag/14.3.1),
and has an MSRV (minimum supported Rust version) of 1.85.

- Add support for shaping legacy AAT `mort` tables, including
  language-specific morph features (#451, #453).
- Handle tuple kerning in AAT `kerx` tables (#452).
- Fix a debug assertion for legacy `kern` state tables that declare more than
  256 classes (#455).
- Synthesize Arabic fallback GSUB lookups, including legacy Windows-1256
  glyph layouts and `no_std` builds (#454, #456).
- Update `read-fonts` to 0.43.3.

## [0.13.2] - 2026-08-23

This release matches HarfBuzz [v14.3.1](https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/releases/tag/14.3.1),
and has an MSRV (minimum supported Rust version) of 1.85.

- Speed up contextual and chained-context lookup matching by probing raw rule
  offsets and reusing parsed coverage tables (#437).
- Skip the redundant per-subtable digest test for single-subtable lookups
  (#438).
- Set up glyph-set acceleration before applying legacy `kern` tables (#439).
- Precompute and pack AAT state-machine safe-to-break probes in the face cache
  (#445).

  temporaries on every shape (#446, #447).

## [0.13.1] - 2026-08-21

This release matches HarfBuzz [v14.3.1](https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/releases/tag/14.3.1),
and has an MSRV (minimum supported Rust version) of 1.85.

- Saturate shaping and positioning math across GPOS, kerx, trak, fallback,
  shaping, metrics, and font scaling paths to avoid overflow and better match
  HarfBuzz behavior (#420).
- Cache GDEF mark filtering sets in bitmaps (#421).
- Lock `icu_properties` to 2.2.0 (#422).
- Optimize hot loops in contextual and layout matching by probing rules before
  parsing, hoisting invariants, moving recursion state instead of cloning, and
  replacing per-element copies with block copies (#423, #424, #425).
- Optimize buffer internals by copying small counts inline and charging
  `move_to` operations against `max_ops` (#426, #429).
- Improve AAT shaping performance by walking `morx` subtables through packed
  descriptors, resolving subtable kinds from cached parts, and adding a
  state-machine fast path (#428, #430, #431).
- Skip the post-`morx` digest update when GPOS is not present (#433).
- Add a batched nominal-glyph callback to `FontFuncs` (#434).
- Update `read-fonts` to 0.43.2 (#432, #435).
