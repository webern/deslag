## 2025-04-05 - Wait UI Bounds Tooltip Accessibility
**Learning:** When disabling interactive elements (like increment/decrement buttons) in HTML UI overlays, using the native `disabled` attribute suppresses pointer events in many modern browsers, preventing `title` tooltips from appearing.
**Action:** Use `aria-disabled="true"` coupled with visual styling changes (e.g., opacity, cursor: not-allowed) and manual action blocking in the event handler instead of native `disabled` to ensure tooltips remain accessible to both mouse hover and screen readers.

## 2025-04-08 - Accessible Custom Toggles with aria-expanded
**Learning:** Missing `aria-expanded` attributes on custom HTML UI toggles (e.g. accordion triggers that expand/collapse content sections) creates an accessibility failure, as screen readers cannot interpret the open/closed state. The toggle state must be explicitly managed within its click listener. Additionally, linking the toggle element to the controlled content using `aria-controls` is essential.
**Action:** Always verify custom disclosure or accordion components use `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`. Set an initial state and dynamically update `aria-expanded` via `setAttribute` whenever the layout toggles between visible or hidden states.

## 2025-04-10 - Button type Accessibility
**Learning:** Buttons created dynamically with `document.createElement("button")` default to `type="submit"` which can cause unwanted form submissions.
**Action:** Always set `type="button"` on dynamically created buttons that are not intended to submit forms.
## 2026-05-05 - Button type Accessibility
**Learning:** Buttons created dynamically with `document.createElement("button")` default to `type="submit"` which can cause unwanted form submissions. This is a common pattern in HTML-based UI overlays.
**Action:** Always set `type="button"` on dynamically created buttons that are not intended to submit forms. Use `btn.type = "button";`.
## 2026-05-11 - Title Attribute Restoration for Disabled States
**Learning:** When HTML elements like buttons are temporarily disabled and visually styled to indicate this (e.g. using `aria-disabled`), their default `title` attribute is often overridden to explain why they are disabled (e.g. "Maximum hours reached"). A common mistake when re-enabling the button is to use `removeAttribute('title')`, which strips the tooltip completely for the active state.
**Action:** When re-enabling an interactive element, explicitly restore its original descriptive `title` attribute via `setAttribute('title', '...')` instead of removing it, ensuring the element remains accessible and informative on hover.

## 2026-05-14 - Skill Tree Upgrade Button Accessibility
**Learning:** Using the native `disabled` attribute on UI buttons suppresses pointer events, making hover tooltips invisible and removing the button from tab focus, harming accessibility for users needing to understand why an option like "Upgrade Skill" is unavailable.
**Action:** Replaced native `disabled` assignment with `aria-disabled="true"`, added inline `opacity: 0.5` and `cursor: not-allowed` styles, dynamically assigned explanatory `title` attributes based on the disabled reason (e.g., "Prerequisites not met"), and explicitly checked `if (btn.getAttribute("aria-disabled") === "true") return;` in click handlers.
## 2024-11-20 - [ARIA Disabled Tooltip Preservation]
**Learning:** When improving accessibility by replacing native `disabled` properties with `aria-disabled="true"`, ensuring `title` tooltips remain accessible, native DOM pointer events (like `mouseenter` and `mouseleave`) will suddenly fire on these dynamically 'disabled' elements.
**Action:** When migrating UI components to use `aria-disabled`, you must also check and update all pointer event listeners (like hover styling logic) to explicitly check `if (element.getAttribute("aria-disabled") === "true")` so the component visually mimics the native disabled lack of interactivity while remaining accessible.
