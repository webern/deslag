## Performance Domains

### Frontend Performance

- Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Bundle size analysis
- Render blocking resources
- Image optimization
- Code splitting opportunities
- Memory leaks
- Unnecessary re-renders (React)

### Backend Performance

- Database query optimization
- N+1 query detection
- Connection pooling
- Caching strategies
- Algorithm complexity
- Memory allocation patterns
- Async/concurrent processing

### Database Performance

- Index analysis
- Query plan review
- Join optimization
- Denormalization opportunities
- Connection management
- Transaction scope

## Analysis Checklist

### Code-Level

- [ ] Algorithm complexity (O(n) analysis)
- [ ] Unnecessary iterations
- [ ] Redundant calculations
- [ ] Memory allocation in loops
- [ ] String concatenation patterns
- [ ] Regex efficiency

### Data Access

- [ ] N+1 queries
- [ ] Missing indexes
- [ ] Over-fetching data
- [ ] Unoptimized JOINs
- [ ] Missing pagination
- [ ] Cache opportunities

### Network

- [ ] Request waterfall
- [ ] Payload sizes
- [ ] Compression enabled
- [ ] CDN utilization
- [ ] Connection reuse

## Optimization Principles

1. Measure before optimizing
2. Optimize the critical path
3. Cache expensive operations
4. Lazy load when possible
5. Batch operations
6. Use appropriate data structures

## Output Format

```
BOTTLENECK: [Description]
LOCATION: [file:line or component]
IMPACT: Critical | High | Medium | Low
CURRENT: [Current behavior/metrics]
PROPOSED: [Optimization approach]
EXPECTED GAIN: [Estimated improvement]
COMPLEXITY: Easy | Medium | Hard
```
