# Wandas Scalability Benchmark

Treat [`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md) as the repository source of truth. Use the
repository benchmark for manual before/after evidence supporting the
[scalability contract](../../../docs/src/explanation/scalability-contract.md); treat
[`test_scalability_benchmark.py`](../../../tests/test_scalability_benchmark.py) as
schema and smoke coverage only.

## Decide whether representative evidence is required

1. Identify whether the change can affect a metric emitted by
   [`scalability_benchmark.py`](../../../scripts/scalability_benchmark.py) or a measured
   materialization boundary.
2. Require representative base/candidate evidence for an affected path.
3. Otherwise record why the changed paths cannot affect the benchmark.

## Prepare comparable revisions

- Record the base and candidate commit SHAs before either run.
- Use the same machine, operating system, Python version, and dependency lock.
- When dependencies intentionally change, record both lock identities and treat their
  effect as part of the result.
- Use separate clean worktrees when switching revisions would disturb active work.
- If the base has an incompatible benchmark schema, use a bridge command accepted by
  both revisions and identify non-comparable fields. Run the command from the measured
  worktree and pass `--repository-root /path/to/measured-worktree` when the harness file
  comes from another checkout; this keeps the recorded commit and lock attributed to the
  code under measurement. If the base has no benchmark, state that no before comparison
  exists.

## Run schema version 2

Run the representative matrix, which isolates every sample-count/chunk-size pair:

```bash
uv run --locked --no-dev --extra io python scripts/scalability_benchmark.py \
  --channels 2 --samples 480000 4800000 \
  --chunk-samples 48000 480000 --sampling-rate 48000 \
  --output /tmp/wandas-scalability-candidate.json
```

Use a small matrix only for smoke or debugging:

```bash
uv run --locked --no-dev --extra io python scripts/scalability_benchmark.py \
  --channels 2 --samples 8000 --chunk-samples 1000 4000 \
  --sampling-rate 48000 --output /tmp/wandas-scalability-smoke.json
```

Compare fixed data size across chunk sizes and fixed chunk size across data sizes.
Compare task counts and WDF file sizes exactly when their definitions are unchanged.
Compare timings and absolute worker-lifetime RSS only within the same environment.
Rerun a material timing or RSS difference to distinguish it from ordinary noise. Do
not invent a repository-wide pass/fail budget.

## Record the evidence

The harness records the revision and dirty state, exact command, environment, and
`uv.lock` identity in each raw report. Use `--output` with `/tmp`, `$RUNNER_TEMP`, or
another transient path outside the checkout, then attach the JSON to the PR or upload
it as a CI artifact. Record reruns, non-comparable fields, and a concise conclusion in
the PR. When skipped, record the specific reason.

Do not commit raw benchmark JSON, per-issue harness copies, or archived observations
to the documentation tree. Commit benchmark data only when a test intentionally reads
it as a fixture. User documentation should state stable behavior and limitations; use
the PR as the durable review and evidence record.
