# MusicXML MX API Gaps

Notes collected while implementing Denigma's MusicXML exporter. These are MusicXML features or Finale/MUSX requirements that are currently difficult or impossible to express through `mx::api`. Denigma implementation work and MusicXML specification limitations belong in the [MusicXML feature roadmap](roadmap.md), not here.

## Compressed MusicXML Archives

### Score, linked parts, and archive relationships

The MusicXML archive format can contain a root score document and related part documents. For Denigma, a useful `.mxl` export must package the score and every linked part that the converter can emit, rather than placing only the score in an archive. The archive must preserve the relationship between those documents through the appropriate MusicXML linking model and identify the score as the package root.

Denigma's converter currently emits the score and parts as independent multi-output documents. `mx::api` has no package-level model for collecting those documents, assigning their archive paths, expressing the score-to-part relationships, or coordinating the root `META-INF/container.xml` entry with the linked documents. The existing ZIP utilities can write archive entries, but they do not provide this semantic layer.

Needed API shape: a package or multi-document export model that owns the score and linked parts, assigns stable document names, records the score/part relationships, and exposes the root document and archive entries to the writer. This is the prerequisite for meaningful compressed export. A score-only archive is a possible mechanical proof of concept, but is not a useful user-facing Denigma feature by itself.

### Embedded SVG shape resources

Finale's compressed MusicXML files may also carry SVG resources for Shape Designer artwork and link those resources from the MusicXML documents. The exporter already has SVG shape generation, but `mx::api` has no package-resource model for declaring embedded graphics, assigning archive paths, or linking them from the relevant MusicXML elements.

Properly converting Finale shapes that contain embedded text also requires access to the fonts used by those shapes and a font rasterization or outline library such as FreeType. That is a particular deployment challenge for WebAssembly builds, but it affects any environment where the source Finale fonts are unavailable. Without those fonts, an SVG conversion may preserve the shape geometry while rendering embedded text incorrectly or not at all.

Needed API shape: optional package resources with MIME type, stable archive path, and links from the MusicXML representation to the resource. The rendering path additionally needs a reliable font-loading and FreeType-compatible policy for the target environment. This should remain separate from the score/part packaging work: SVG shape embedding may improve fidelity, but it is not a prerequisite for the core linked-score-and-parts archive, and importer support appears inconsistent.

## Staff Details

### Staff-details fields beyond staff-lines and staff-size

MusicXML `<staff-details>` can represent more than line count and staff size, including staff type, staff tuning, capo, and print controls.

`mx::api::StaffData` currently exposes `staffLines`, `staffSize`, and `staffScaling`. Denigma can export those simple staff-detail values, but cannot express the rest of Finale's staff details through `mx::api`.

Needed API shape: a staff details data object with optional fields for the MusicXML `<staff-details>` children and attributes that MX intends to support.

### Mid-measure staff details

MusicXML allows `<attributes>` elements mid-measure, and `<attributes>` may include `<staff-details>`. The spec says mid-measure attributes affect the music in score order.

`mx::api::StaffData::staffLines`, `staffSize`, and `staffScaling` are currently single scalars with no tick position. MX writes them during the measure-start attributes phase, so Denigma can only express measure-start staff detail changes through the current API.

Needed API shape: positionable staff details data, likely a vector on `StaffData`, with `tickTimePosition` and fields such as `staffLines`, `staffSize`, and `staffScaling`.

## Clefs

### Clef size percent

MusicXML `<clef>` supports size-related attributes such as symbolic `size` and font-size/style attributes. Finale mid-measure clef entries include a percent value.

`mx::api::ClefData` does not expose clef size or font-size controls. Denigma cannot currently export Finale's per-clef percentage setting through `mx::api`.

The shared symbolic `size` attribute belongs to the cross-element gap below. The remaining clef-specific need is a font-size control, or another supported mapping that can represent Finale's arbitrary percentage value.

## Symbol Sizes

### Consistent `symbol-size` support across applicable elements

MusicXML uses the shared `symbol-size` values `full`, `cue`, `grace-cue`, and `large` on several elements, including note `<type>`, `<accidental>`, `<accidental-mark>`, `<clef>`, and `<level>`. This visual sizing is distinct from the semantic meaning of the element.

`mx::api` does not expose this attribute consistently. In particular, `mx::api::DurationData` carries the note type but not its `size`, while `mx::api::NoteData::isCue` only requests the semantic `<cue/>` element. The writer therefore cannot emit an explicit `<type size="cue">` or `<type size="grace-cue">`.

MusicXML defines an implicit cue size for a note containing `<cue/>`, and an implicit grace-cue size when `<grace>` and `<cue/>` are both present. However, importers do not all honor those defaults consistently. Denigma should retain `<cue/>` for cue semantics and also explicitly set `<type size="cue">` on ordinary cue notes and rests and `<type size="grace-cue">` on cue grace notes. The size must remain independently controllable so that the API can also represent visually cue-sized notes that are not semantic cues.

Needed API shape: one public symbol-size enum, exposed by each API data type whose MusicXML element supports the shared `size` attribute, with complete reader, writer, and comparison support. For notes, the field should belong to the data that writes `<type>` and remain independent of `NoteData::isCue` and grace state.

This should be addressed as one cross-element MX API feature after the pending MX API pull requests have merged, rather than as a cue-note-only field. Once available, Denigma should explicitly populate it for both cue notes and cue grace notes.

## Ties

### Notation-only ties and one-ended visual ties

MusicXML separates sounding ties (`<tie>`) from notated ties (`<notations><tied>`). The `<tied>` element supports `start`, `stop`, `continue`, and `let-ring`. For visually one-ended ties that are not let-ring ties, the MusicXML guidance is to write both `<tied type="start"/>` and `<tied type="stop"/>` on the same note, in that order. This is used for ties into or out of repeats, endings, or codas. These visual ties should not necessarily produce a corresponding `<tie>` element, because `<tie>` represents playback semantics.

`mx::api::NoteData` exposes `isTieStart` and `isTieStop`, and `NoteWriter` maps those booleans to both `<tie>` and `<tied>` together, only as normal start/stop ties. The generic `CurveType::tie` attachment path can emit notation-only start, stop, and continue elements, so a simple visual tie can be represented by treating it as a generic curve. However, that path is separate from the semantic tie booleans and does not solve same-note start/stop ordering. Denigma therefore has no unified public API for independently controlling the playback and notation sides of a tie.

Needed API shape: a tie-notation data model separate from playback tie booleans, with support for `start`, `stop`, `continue`, and same-note start/stop ordering. The API should also allow notation-only ties without writing `<tie>`, and should allow playback `<tie>` / `time-only` semantics to be modeled separately when Denigma can infer them.

### Curve orientation on a regular (paired) tie

Finale can freeze a tie's curvature direction on a per-note basis (`details::TieAlterStart`), and its own MusicXML export writes this as `<tied orientation="over|under" type="start"/>` even on an ordinary paired tie (one with a matching `<tie>`/`<tied type="stop">` elsewhere).

`mx::api::NoteData::isTieStart`/`isTieStop` write both `<tie>` and an undecorated `<tied>` together, with no orientation field. The only other channel for `<tied>` orientation is `mx::api::TieLetRing` (which hardcodes `type="let-ring"`, so it cannot represent a paired tie) or a `CurveType::tie` entry in `noteAttachmentData.curveStarts`/`curveStops` (which `NotationsWriter` emits as its own separate `<notations>` block, independent of `isTieStart`/`isTieStop`). Setting both on the same note does not merge the two — it produces two `<notations>` blocks, each with its own `<tied type="start">`, i.e. duplicated/conflicting notation rather than one decorated `<tied>`. Switching to the `CurveType::tie` path instead of `isTieStart` would fix the duplication but silently drop the sound-level `<tie>`, since that element is only ever written from `isTieStart`/`isTieStop`. Denigma therefore currently applies `TieAlterStart` orientation only to let-ring ties (`applyTieAlterStart` in `musicxml_notes.cpp`), and drops it for regular paired ties.

Needed API shape: the same tie-notation data model requested above should also carry the shared curve attributes (orientation, placement, position, color) available on `CurveStart`/`CurveStop`, so a paired tie can be decorated without a second, conflicting `<notations>` block or the loss of `<tie>`.

## Measures

### Multimeasure-rest attributes

`mx::api::MeasureData` supports the multimeasure-rest span and the `multiple-rest` `use-symbols` attribute. Denigma exports matching part-scoped `others::MultimeasureRest` records, including Finale's effective choice between rest symbols and a multimeasure-rest shape.

MusicXML also permits the enclosing `measure-style` `number` (staff) attribute, which `mx::api` does not expose. Finale/MUSX additionally records symbol spacing, a custom multimeasure-rest shape and dimensions, and number visibility and placement. Those layout details have no direct MusicXML equivalent.

### Alternate notation: measure repeats and slash notation

Finale's effective staff setting `others::Staff::AlternateNotation` can request one-bar repeats, two-bar repeats, slash notation on beats, or rhythmic notation. It can be changed by a staff style over a measure range and can apply to one Finale layer. MUSX supplies the effective notation, target layer, compound-meter slash-dot setting, rhythmic stem direction, and several options for hiding the affected or other layers' content.

MusicXML has direct measure-style vocabulary for the principal display modes: `<measure-repeat type="start">1</measure-repeat>` and `2` for one- and two-bar repeats, and `<slash type="start" use-stems="no|yes">` for slash-on-beats and rhythmic notation. These styles require a corresponding `type="stop"` at the first measure after the effective range. The actual music must remain in every MusicXML measure; measure-style controls its display rather than replacing the musical content.

MX's generated core layer models all three elements, but `mx::api` has no public data model for `measure-repeat`, `beat-repeat`, or `slash`, and its reader and writer do not handle them. Denigma consequently exports the underlying entries as ordinary notation and loses the alternate display mode.

Needed API shape: a staff-scoped, positionable measure-style collection on `MeasureData`. It should model start/stop state; measure-repeat pattern length and optional slash count; slash or beat-repeat `useStems`, `useDots`, display beat, and excluded voices; and the optional MusicXML staff number. This should supersede the scalar multimeasure-rest field with a common measure-style data object, or coexist with it while sharing the same writer path.

Full Finale fidelity is not possible through measure style alone. `altLayer` has no general equivalent for measure repeats, while slash/beat-repeat can only exclude other MusicXML voices. `Blank` and `BlankWithRests`, and Finale's independent hide-articulation, lyrics, expressions, and smart-shape settings, require selective `print-object="no"` handling in addition to any measure style. The alternate-notation slash and number fonts, glyph-position options, and two-bar-repeat number offset are likewise Finale-specific layout data with no direct standard MusicXML mapping.

## Transposition

### Concert-score `for-part`

MusicXML supports `<for-part>` in `<attributes>` for concert scores with transposed parts. This allows a concert-score file to describe transpositions for extracted or rendered parts.

`mx::api` currently exposes `PartData::transposition`, but not an API for `<for-part>`.

Needed API shape: an API model for `<for-part>` under measure attributes, including the target part identity and associated transposition data.

## Instruments and Sound

### Instrument changes within a part

MusicXML supports multiple instruments per part and can represent changes via score instruments, MIDI instruments, and sound/playback data.

`mx::api::PartData` currently has one `InstrumentData instrumentData` for the part. Denigma can set initial part/instrument metadata, but cannot express Finale staff-style instrument changes or multiple simultaneous instruments within the same part through the current simple field.

Needed API shape: multiple score instruments per part, plus positionable instrument-change or playback-change data that can be emitted where the instrument changes.

### Per-note instrument assignment

MusicXML assigns a note to one of a part's instruments with `<note><instrument id="..."/>`, an IDREF back to a `<score-instrument>`. The spec is explicit about when it is required: "If multiple score-instruments are specified in a score-part, there should be an instrument element for each note in the part." A note shared between instruments may carry more than one. This is what makes a drum kit expressible, since each staff position is a different instrument within one part.

Most of the surrounding percussion vocabulary is already available, and it is worth recording so it is not re-derived. `mx::api::NoteData::isUnpitched` selects `<unpitched>` over `<pitch>`, with `pitchData`'s step and octave serving as display step and octave, which is what the spec requires for notes in a percussion clef. `MidiData::unpitched` carries `<midi-unpitched>`. `PercussionData` models the `<percussion>` pictogram direction.

What is missing is the link between a note and an instrument: `NoteData` has no instrument member, so every note in a part is implicitly the part's single instrument. Combined with `PartData` holding one `InstrumentData` (see instrument changes within a part, above), a multi-instrument percussion staff cannot be expressed at all: neither the several `<score-instrument>` definitions nor the per-note references to them. Denigma consequently exports a drum kit as one pitched instrument.

Needed API shape: an instrument reference on `NoteData`, allowing more than one, keyed to whatever identity the multiple-score-instruments support settles on. The two are one feature in practice and should be designed together; per-note references are useless without several instruments to point at, and several instruments are unusable without per-note references, since the spec expects one on every note once a part has more than one instrument.

Denigma-side work is tracked under percussion in [roadmap.md](roadmap.md).

### Nested sound children

MusicXML `<sound>` can include nested child elements such as `<midi-instrument>`, `<midi-device>`, `<play>`, `<swing>`, and `<offset>`.

`mx::api::SoundData` models common scalar attributes and `<swing>`, but not the other nested child elements.

Needed API shape: optional support for nested sound children that matter for Denigma's playback export, especially if Finale data requires instrument-specific playback changes.

## Part Groups and Display

### Part-group display positioning

MusicXML name-display elements can carry formatting and position data, including placement controls that matter when multiple brackets or braces overlap.

`mx::api::PartGroupData` currently stores group names, abbreviations, bracket type, group barline, and number, but not display positioning data for group names or symbols.

Denigma will probably not try to export part-name or part-group positioning overrides, or will export very few of them. This is therefore a low-priority gap for Denigma, but it remains a possible API limitation for applications that need exact layout round-tripping.

Needed API shape: position/print data for group-name-display, group-abbreviation-display, and possibly group-symbol placement.

## Page Text and Credits

### Mixed formatting within a credit

Finale page-attached text can change font, size, and style within one text block. MusicXML can preserve this with multiple ordered `<credit-words>` elements in a single `<credit>`, each carrying its own formatting.

`mx::api::PageTextData` contains one string and one `FontData`, and its writer emits exactly one `<credit-words>`. Denigma therefore concatenates all visible Enigma text chunks and applies the first visible chunk's font to the complete credit. Hidden-font chunks are omitted.

Needed API shape: an ordered collection of formatted credit words/symbol chunks within one `PageTextData`, with independent font and position data for each chunk.

## Barlines and Endings

### Repeat-ending appearance and visibility

MusicXML `<ending>` carries, besides `number`, `type`, and its display text, the appearance attributes `print-object`, `end-length`, `text-x`, `text-y`, `system`, and the whole `print-style` group. Finale supplies a value for each of them: `RepeatEndingStart::hidden` for `print-object`, `endLineVPos` for `end-length`, `textHPos` and `textVPos` for `text-x` and `text-y`, `topStaffOnly` for `system`, the bracket corner offsets for `default-x` and `default-y`, and `FontOptions::FontType::Ending` for the font. Finale's own export writes them, as in `<ending default-y="40" end-length="30" font-size="8.5" number="4" print-object="yes" system="only-top" type="start">`.

`mx::api::EndingData` exposes `type`, `numbers`, and `text` only, so Denigma exports the ending's structure and label but none of its placement, size, or visibility. Hidden endings are the notable loss, because they are structural in Finale rather than decorative: the bracket is suppressed while the repeat still governs playback.

Needed API shape: `PositionData` and `FontData` members on `EndingData` in line with other positionable API types, plus a print-object flag, an end-length value, the text offsets, and the `system` placement enum, with reader and writer support for each.

## Directions and Expressions

### Per-minute font in metronome marks

MusicXML lets `<per-minute>` carry its own font attributes, independently of the enclosing
`<metronome>`. Finale uses that distinction when the metronome note and its number come from
different fonts. In `metronome_marks.musx`, Finale writes Finale Maestro Text on `<metronome>` and
Times New Roman Bold on `<per-minute>` for the split-font whole-note mark.

`mx::api::TempoData::fontData` can represent the enclosing metronome font, but
`mx::api::BeatsPerMinute` stores only the per-minute string. `MetronomeReader` consequently
discards the child font attributes, and `DirectionWriter` cannot emit them. Denigma can preserve a
single font on the enclosing metronome, but cannot fully preserve a split-font mark through the
current API.

Needed API shape: add `FontData` for the per-minute value to `BeatsPerMinute`, with reader, writer,
and comparison support. A default-constructed `FontData` should leave the child attributes
unstated so it inherits the enclosing metronome font.

### Keyboard pedal appearance, identity, and playback

Finale custom-line smart shapes can use independent start, continuation, and end text; visible or blank lines;
ordinary hooks; four custom pedal-cap shapes; and solid, dashed, or character-based line bodies. MusicXML pedal
directions also support `line`, `sign`, `abbreviated`, and `number` attributes.

`mx::api::PedalLineData` exposes the complete MusicXML pedal-line event vocabulary, including sostenuto, change,
continue, discontinue, and resume, but carries only the event kind, tick, and position. Its writer always emits
`line="yes"` and does not expose sign selection, abbreviation, or identity numbers. MusicXML 3.1 and later use
the `number` attribute to distinguish simultaneous lines such as damper and sostenuto pedals, and
`mx::core::Pedal` supports it, but `mx::api` does not.

MusicXML does not provide dash or hook geometry on `<pedal>`, nor a visual pedal type for una corda / Pedal III;
visible notation for those cases uses words and bracket/dashes directions. It does represent una-corda playback through
`<sound soft-pedal="...">`, including numeric half-pedal values, but `mx::api::SoundData` does not expose that
attribute. Denigma can preserve visible una-corda text and brackets through general direction words and lines, but
cannot preserve its playback semantics. Finale custom hook geometry, continuation text, and character-based line
bodies have no direct MusicXML pedal equivalent.

Needed API shape: extend `PedalLineData` with `sign`, `abbreviated`, and `number`, with reader/writer support and
pedal-aware number resolution. Correct `SpannerNumberResolver`'s MusicXML-3.0-era claim that `<pedal>` has no
`number` attribute. `SoundData` should also expose MusicXML's `soft-pedal` playback attribute.

### Direction-level technique playback

Finale technique text such as `pizz.`, `arco`, and `mute` carries playback meaning as well as visible text.

Denigma keeps technique text as a words direction. Only the playback-style `arco`/`pizzicato` values are copied into `DirectionData::soundData.pizzicato`; the rest remain textual until `mx::api` grows richer playback or direction-technical modeling.

Needed API shape: direction-level playback or technical modeling for the remaining technique vocabulary, so a recognized technique can carry its playback effect alongside its words.

## Tuplets

### Tuplet spanner numbers are unmanaged

`TupletStart` and `TupletStop` carry a raw `int numberLevel` rather than an `api::SpannerNumber`, so tuplets are the one spanner family `mx::impl::SpannerResolver` does not handle: `NotationsWriter` writes the level verbatim while curves, wedges, octave shifts, brackets, dashes, glissandi, slides, and wavy lines all route through `emittedNumber`. The author therefore owns allocating and recycling tuplet levels, including keeping them distinct across the whole part.

Needed API shape: `SpannerNumber` on `TupletStart`/`TupletStop` with resolver support, extending the writer-side assignment that the other families received in MX PR #320. Denigma's current part-scope exposure is recorded in [roadmap.md](roadmap.md).

## Tablature

### Per-note string and fret

MusicXML notates tablature with `<notations><technical><string>N</string><fret>N</fret></technical>` on each note, alongside a `<clef><sign>TAB</sign>` and the staff tuning described below. The two values are the whole of tablature's note content: the spec says a TAB clef is sufficient to indicate that noteheads are fret numbers, so nothing else per-note is required.

`mx::api` exposes neither. `NoteData` and `NoteAttachmentData` have no string or fret member, and `MarkType` covers only the valueless technical marks such as `upBow`, `openString`, and `thumbPosition`, so there is no existing slot a numeric value could ride in. String numbers are modeled in exactly one place, `AccordData::stringNumber` for `<scordatura>`, which is a direction rather than a note attachment and cannot carry a fret. Denigma therefore cannot express tablature note content at all, and a Finale TAB staff exports as ordinary pitched notes.

Needed API shape: string and fret members on the note-attached technical data, with reader, writer, and comparison support. `<string>` and `<fret>` are ordinary `<technical>` children, so a general technical-data object holding both the valued and valueless members would serve this and the remaining `<technical>` vocabulary at once.

### Tablature staff details

A tablature staff also needs `<staff-details>` carrying `<staff-tuning>` for each line, with its `<tuning-step>`, `<tuning-octave>`, and `<tuning-alter>`, plus `<capo>` and `<show-frets>` for the numbers-or-letters choice. Finale supplies all of these: the `others::FretInstrument` at `Staff::fretInstId` gives each open string's pitch, `Staff::capoPos` the capo, and `Staff::useTabLetters` the letter display.

`mx::api::StaffData` exposes `staffLines`, `staffSize`, and `staffScaling` only. This is the tablature-specific face of the staff-details gap recorded above under Staff Details, and the two should be solved together rather than as separate features.

Needed API shape: as in that entry, a staff-details data object with optional fields for the `<staff-details>` children, including a staff-tuning collection keyed by line, capo, and show-frets.

Denigma-side work is tracked under tablature staves in [roadmap.md](roadmap.md), including the fret computation that Finale leaves implicit.

## Harmony and Fretboards

### Printed text on chord degrees

MusicXML lets each `<degree>` child carry the text that should be printed for it: `<degree-value text="maj7">7</degree-value>` and `<degree-type text="add">add</degree-type>`. Finale relies on this. It writes the chord's base spelling in `<kind text="m9">` and moves the parenthesized remainder onto the degree elements, so the whole suffix renders exactly once.

`mx::api::Extension` models `extensionType`, `extensionAlter`, `extensionNumber`, and `printObject`, but has no text member, so Denigma cannot place the printed spelling on a degree. Denigma therefore writes the entire displayed suffix in `ChordData::text` and must suppress each degree with `print-object="no"` to avoid rendering the parenthesized text twice, which loses the degree text that Finale exports.

Needed API shape: an optional printed-text member on `Extension` for the `degree-value` and `degree-type` `text` attributes, so an exporter can split a suffix between the kind and its degrees the way Finale does.

### Bass note arrangement

Finale exports an altered-bass chord as `<bass arrangement="horizontal">`, choosing between a horizontal, diagonal, or vertical arrangement of the root and bass.

`mx::api::ChordData` exposes `bass` and `bassAlter` but no arrangement member, so Denigma cannot record Finale's choice and the reading application picks its own layout.

Needed API shape: an optional bass arrangement enumeration on `ChordData` covering the MusicXML `arrangement` values.
