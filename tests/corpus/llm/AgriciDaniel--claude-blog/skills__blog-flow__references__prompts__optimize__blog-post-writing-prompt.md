# Blog Post Writing Prompt

## Use This When

Use this prompt when you need a structured optimize deliverable and want the model to separate observations, assumptions, recommended actions, and claims that need verification.

## AI Compatibility

Works with long-context reasoning models. For smaller models, provide narrower inputs and ask for one output section at a time.

## Inputs

- Blog, publication, product, or website name.
- Target article, hub page, query set, or campaign.
- Audience and geography where relevant.
- Existing evidence: analytics, search results, reader research, source notes, sales objections, or content inventory.
- Constraints, exclusions, and required sources.

## Prompt

```text
Act as a senior SEO strategist using the FLOW model.

Task: create an Optimize-stage blog deliverable for: [ARTICLE, HUB, OR SITE].

Use only the supplied inputs and clearly label any assumption. Do not invent statistics. Do not reuse private examples. Build the answer around:
1. Searcher or buyer intent.
2. Evidence available now.
3. Gaps that block trust, extraction, or conversion.
4. Recommended changes in priority order.
5. Measurement events and review cadence.
6. Claims that require source verification before publication.

Return a concise working document the team can execute.
```

## Output

- Executive summary.
- Priority table.
- Recommended copy, structure, or audit findings.
- Evidence needed.
- Measurement plan.
- Verification checklist.

## Example

Input: a blog post or hub page with weak proof, thin source support, and an unclear conversion path.

Expected output: a prioritized content brief, claims to verify, internal links to add, and the conversion event to measure.
