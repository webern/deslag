## The developer story

```php
public function generateReport(): void
{
    $this->generating = true; // spinner shows on the next (immediate) re-render

    AsyncTask::dispatch(static function () {
        // Runs on a SEPARATE PHP thread with its OWN interpreter.
        // Must be a static closure — no $this, nothing unserializable captured.
        return ExpensiveReport::build()->toArray();
    })
        ->finished(function (array $result) {
            // Back on the UI thread, rebound to this live component.
            $this->report = $result;
            $this->generating = false;
        })
        ->failed(function (Throwable $e) {
            $this->generating = false;
            $this->error = $e->getMessage();
        });
}
```

Sugar on `NativeComponent` for the common in-component case:

```php
$this->async(static fn () => ExpensiveReport::build()->toArray())
    ->finished(fn ($result) => $this->report = $result);
```

Both forms return a `PendingAsyncTask`.

## Why this is mostly glue, not new infrastructure

Two halves already exist in the codebase; async tasks are the bridge between them.

1. **A real background PHP thread.** Each platform already boots independent PHP
   interpreter contexts on their own threads with their own TSRM storage — the
   queue worker (`worker_php_*`), the ephemeral lane (`ephemeral_php_*`), and the
   per-webview lanes (`webview_php_*`). Async tasks add one more lane of the same
   shape (`async_php_*`) — deliberately **not** the queue worker (see §Decisions).

2. **A completion channel into the parked UI runloop.** The fluent-callback
   machinery built for Camera (`NativeCallbacks` + `fireNativeCallback()` in
   `NativeComponent`) already: stores a callback correlated by id, receives a
   native event that wakes `nativephp_element_wait_event()`
   (`nphp_element_post_event` / `sendNativeEvent`), rebinds the callback to the
   **live** component, runs it, and re-renders. That is exactly `->finished()`.

The only missing piece was a way for a background PHP context to say "I'm done"
back to the UI runloop, plus a small API surface on top.

## Data flow

```
UI PHP thread (component runloop)          Async PHP thread (own interpreter)
────────────────────────────────           ──────────────────────────────────
handler: AsyncTask::dispatch($work)
  → serialize $work (SerializableClosure)
  → write payload → storage/framework/async/payload/<id>.task
  → NativeCallbacks::register(id, …)        (finished/failed stored, screen-tagged)
  → AsyncTaskRegistry::register(id, origin)
  → nativephp_call('AsyncTask.Dispatch', {id})  ─┐  native assigns a booted async
  → handler returns → re-render (spinner)        │  context and runs:
                                                 ▼
                                    artisan native:async:run --id=<id>
                                      → read + delete payload/<id>.task
                                      → unserialize + run $work → $result
                                      → AsyncTask.Complete(id, event, payload) ─┐
                                                                                │
UI runloop  ◀── sendNativeEvent(event, {id, result}) ◀──────────────────────────┘
  → handleAsyncCompletion: scope check, bind cb to live component, run cb($result)
  → re-render → publish frame
```

No PHP value ever crosses a thread directly — everything is serialized. The
**work payload travels via a temp file** on the shared app filesystem (the UI
and async contexts share it), so the native side never touches it: it just
assigns an async-lane context to run the task and relays the completion event.
It never interprets either.

---

## Decisions (from design review)

1. **Static closures only.** The work closure runs in a different interpreter, so
   it cannot carry `$this` or capture anything unserializable. We **reflect the
   closure at dispatch time and throw immediately** if it is non-static — failing
   in the handler where the developer can see it, not silently in a worker log.
   `finished()`/`failed()` closures **do** bind to the component (they run on the
   UI thread), exactly like Camera callbacks.

2. **Screen scoping, with an opt-out.** By default a `finished()` callback is
   **dropped if the originating screen is no longer topmost** when the result
   arrives — firing a component-bound closure against the wrong live component is
   a footgun (see the id-collision rationale in `CallbackRegistry`). The
   originating screen is held as a **`WeakReference`, not an object id**: PHP
   recycles `spl_object_id`s, so a popped screen's id can be handed to the next
   component allocated and an id comparison would then deliver the callback to an
   unrelated screen. A weak reference to a freed component reads back as `null`,
   which never matches, so the completion is dropped as intended. But a
   component may own a UI element shared across screens (a layout chrome element,
   a mini-player) that should react regardless. For that, `->shared('alias')`
   flips delivery from a component-scoped closure to a **named global event**:
   the result is delivered as a native event named `alias`, handled by any active
   component via `#[On('alias')]` / `->on('alias', …)`. The developer picks it up
   however they like.

3. **`failed()` handler.** Errors serialize down to class + message (+ trace
   string) as an `AsyncTaskFailed` event carrying the same id. Async UI tasks
   default to **one attempt** — silent queue-style retries of a button action are
   surprising.

   **Every dispatch reaches one outcome.** A spinner that never stops is the
   worst failure mode this API can have, so the paths that could deliver
   *nothing* are all closed:

   - **A refused dispatch fails at the call site.** `AsyncTask.Dispatch` returns
     `success`, and PHP checks it. No executor running, no free slot, no bridge,
     or a Jump subprocess that wouldn't launch — the task never started, so
     `->failed()` fires immediately rather than the UI waiting on a result that
     was never coming.
   - **A non-encodable result fails as a task failure.** The result is put
     through its JSON round trip **in the background context**
     (`AsyncTaskRunner::normalizeResult()`), where a failure can still be
     reported as an ordinary `AsyncTaskFailed`. Left to `json_encode()` in the
     transport it would just return `false` and nothing would be delivered.
   - **A hung task times out.** Every dispatch carries a deadline (default 60s,
     `->timeout($seconds)`, `0` to disable) plus the exact completion to post if
     it passes. The native watchdog holds both and posts the pre-built failure
     event when the deadline expires, so native still never has to know how a
     failure event is shaped. The work itself is *not* killed on device — a PHP
     interpreter mid-task can't be interrupted safely — so the timeout unblocks
     the UI, and a late completion for a task already reported as failed is
     discarded (its callbacks are gone). Jump has no native watchdog, so the
     transport sweeps overdue subprocesses on each runloop tick instead.

   **A note on the event channel underneath it.** Until format v4,
   `nphp_element_post_event()` was a **single slot, not a queue** — it always
   wrote at offset 0 and set `event_count` to 1 as a flag, so a second post
   landing before PHP drained the first overwrote it silently. This lane was the
   first thing to post into that channel from several OS threads at once (four
   pool threads plus the watchdog), so it was the first thing to expose it:
   measured at 6 concurrent dispatches → 4–5 delivered, the watchdog's own
   timeout event included. **Format v4 made it a real FIFO**, so that bound is
   gone; the app-side handshake is 4 in both readers, and a stale `libphp.a`
   now fails loud rather than being quietly wrong.

   One residual, worth knowing rather than fearing: `nphp_element_post_event()`
   returns `1` queued / `0` dropped, and it drops when the queue is over its
   backlog cap — i.e. when PHP has stopped draining entirely. The general UI
   writer discards that result deliberately (a dropped tap is a dropped tap),
   but a completion is exactly the case that should care, since dropping one
   puts the task back to relying on the watchdog. `AsyncTask.Complete` does not
   check it yet — see the native follow-ups.

4. **Immediate, concurrent, no SQLite, not the queue worker.** Tasks must start
   *now*, not on a ≤3s `queue:work --once` poll, and a developer may run several
   at once. So async tasks get their **own lane** with a small pool of PHP
   contexts, independent of the single queue-worker thread and its SQLite
   `database` queue. Concurrency is bounded (see §Concurrency); excess tasks
   queue in native and log when they do.

   Nothing on this path touches SQLite — but only because the completion
   callbacks are registered with `NativeCallbacks::register(..., durable: false)`.
   Its default tier-2 copy is a cache write (SQLite-backed by default) on the UI
   thread; async tasks skip it deliberately, since the payload and scope metadata
   live in RAM and a temp file, so a process kill loses the whole task anyway and
   a durable callback would have nothing to survive to.

5. **Result size and shape.** The event channel has no hard cap now, but the
   result still round-trips as JSON — objects arrive at `finished()` as arrays.
   Return scalars/arrays; pass large blobs by file path or cache key. The fake
   runs the same normalization, so a test can't pass on a value a device would
   never deliver.

6. **Testing + Jump.**
   - **Testing:** `AsyncTask::fake()` runs the work **inline-synchronously** and
     records dispatches, so tests need no threads. Assertion helpers
     (`assertDispatched`, etc.).
   - **Jump (dev server):** there is no device async lane on the laptop, so the
     Jump fallback spawns a background `php artisan native:async:run` **subprocess**
     on the dev machine (payload handed off via a temp file under
     `storage/framework/async/`), and the subprocess delivers completion back
     through the existing Jump event path. (The "serialize the closure over the
     websocket and run it on the phone" option is noted as a future alternative —
     it would exercise the real device lane from Jump, at the cost of a
     websocket round-trip for the payload.)

7. **`dispatch` terminology, not a real queued Job.** `AsyncTask::dispatch()`
   reads familiarly to Laravel devs but is **not** a `ShouldQueue` job and does
   not pollute the standard queue. `AsyncTask` is an extensible base — a developer
   can subclass it (`class BuildReport extends AsyncTask`) and
   `BuildReport::dispatch($month)->finished(…)`.

8. **Internal vs. surface naming.** Internally we reuse the existing fluent
   `->then()` / `->catch()` vocabulary where it already exists; the public surface
   on `PendingAsyncTask` uses **`finished()` / `failed()`** for clearer intent.

### Parked for later

- **`await()` via Fibers.** A synchronous-looking `$result = $this->await(fn …)`
  that suspends the handler and resumes it on completion would layer cleanly on
  this exact task-id + event plumbing. Parked until we confirm Fiber support in
  the custom PHP binaries and work through handler re-entrancy.

## Concurrency

A bounded pool of async PHP contexts (default 4). Each context is a booted
interpreter reused across tasks (boot cost paid once, like the queue worker).
Tasks beyond the pool size queue in native FIFO; the native side `log()`s when a
task waits so bounded concurrency is never silent. Ordering across tasks is not
guaranteed — each `finished()` fires when its own task completes.

---

## Native surface (two bridge functions + one lane)

The payload moves via a temp file, so native stays a dumb courier with just two
calls:

- `AsyncTask.Dispatch` `{id, timeout?, timeoutEvent?, timeoutPayload?}` → assign
  a booted async-lane context to run `native:async:run --id=<id>`. Returns
  immediately, with a `success` flag PHP acts on (see §3). The timeout trio is
  the watchdog contract: native holds the deadline and the pre-built completion
  to post if it passes, so it still never interprets a task or builds an event.
- `AsyncTask.Complete` `{id, event, payload}` → relay `sendNativeEvent(event,
  payload)` into the UI runloop (this is what wakes the C `wait_event`).

Both executors **stop synchronously**: `stop()` drains in-flight tasks and shuts
each context down before returning, because callers stop the pool immediately
before a persistent-runtime reboot and `php_embed_shutdown` frees Zend module
state a live async context still references. On iOS the pool boots asynchronously,
so `stop()` waits out an in-flight boot rather than returning early — bailing
would leave C slots allocated with nothing able to reclaim them, and `start()`
refusing to run twice would then drop every later dispatch for the life of the app.

The lane also avoids `setenv()`. The single-threaded lanes set
`APP_RUNNING_IN_CONSOLE`/`PHP_SELF` that way, but this one runs several contexts
at once and `setenv`/`getenv` are neither thread-safe nor per-thread — pool
threads would clobber each other and the UI lane. The eval'd code sets the
per-thread `$_SERVER` entries instead, which is what Laravel's `Env` reads.

C lane `async_php_*` mirrors the queue-worker / webview lanes: a pool of
per-thread TSRM contexts that boot the persistent bootstrap once and run
`native:async:run` for tasks handed to them — concurrent, reused, and with no
coupling to the persistent runtime's request mutex. Android
(`AsyncTaskExecutor.kt`) pins each context to a pool thread; iOS
(`AsyncTaskExecutor.swift`) pins each C slot to a serial `DispatchQueue`.

Payload handoff via temp file (rather than a native RAM map keyed by id) keeps
the native surface minimal and truly persistence-free — no database, no queue. The
RAM-map alternative would avoid the disk write but needs a concurrent map plus
lifecycle on each platform; revisit only if temp-file IO shows up in profiling.

### Alternative considered — a userland `nativephp_post_event()`

Rather than routing completion through a bridge function
(`AsyncTask.Complete` → `sendNativeEvent`), the extension could expose a
`nativephp_post_event(type, name, payload)` PHP function that wraps
`nphp_element_post_event` directly. That is **cleaner and has zero native hop** —
the async context would post the wake event itself. We did **not** take it here
because the `nativephp` extension ships **prebuilt** with the runtime, so a new
extension function can't land from this repo; the bridge-function route is the
one shippable without a new PHP binary. Worth revisiting when the extension is
next rebuilt.
