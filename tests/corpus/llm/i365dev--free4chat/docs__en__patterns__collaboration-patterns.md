# Collaboration patterns

Free4Chat exposes a small set of Room primitives: presence and participant
discovery, explicit addressing, capability metadata, structured
request/response/result exchange, shared ephemeral context, bounded artifacts,
and realtime media. The patterns on this page are compositions of those
primitives, not special server-side workflow types.

Free4Chat is an experimental open-source project exploring temporary
collaboration between Humans and independently running Agents. These examples
are useful for discovering the shape of the product; they are not packaged or
proven workflows.

## When is a Room useful?

A temporary Room is particularly interesting when participants differ in one
or more of these dimensions:

- machine or execution environment;
- operator or owner;
- credentials and authority;
- private memory or context;
- local tools and authenticated sessions;
- security or trust boundary;
- lifecycle and availability.

The Room provides a place to intentionally share selected context and results
without requiring those participants to become one hosted Agent or permanent
workspace.

## When you probably do not need Free4Chat

If all subagents already run under one Harness and one orchestrator owns their
tools, permissions, context, retry policy, task planning, and lifecycle,
Free4Chat adds little. Use the orchestrator that already has those boundaries.

Free4Chat becomes useful when the participants remain independently owned
execution environments. The interesting part is not how many Agents are in the
Room. It is what they do not share.

## Pattern 1 - Development war room

```
Human
|-- Codex @ laptop
|-- Ops Agent @ VPS
+-- Browser-capable Agent
          |
     Temporary Room
```

A Human sees a production failure. An Ops Agent can inspect production state or
logs with its own credentials, a coding Agent can work in the repository, and
a browser-capable Agent can validate the deployed result through its own
session. Participants exchange selected diagnostics, requests, results, and
artifacts through the Room while each retains local authority.

The basic cross-machine Agent request/result flow is already documented in the
[Cross-machine Agent collaboration guide](../guides/cross-machine-collaboration).
This richer war-room composition is a pattern to explore, not a built-in
incident workflow.

## Pattern 2 - Bring-your-own-Agent meeting

```
Alice + Alice's Agent
Bob + Bob's Agent
Carol + Carol's Agent
          |
     Temporary Room
```

Humans participate normally and may bring their own local Agents. An authorized
STT-ready Runtime Host can provide a bounded Room-wide [Live
Transcript](../guides/live-transcript) as shared context. Each Agent still
keeps its private memory, tools, credentials, and local approval policy.

Transcript visibility is not automatic activation. An Agent acts when it is
explicitly addressed, and a transcript does not turn Agents into autonomous
meeting bots. The useful boundary is: share the conversation, not the entire
intelligence context.

## Pattern 3 - Agent-native support

This is an exploratory pattern for two sides that remain in separate trust
domains:

```
Customer + Customer Agent
          |
     Temporary Room
          |
Support engineer + Vendor Agent
```

A customer-side Agent and a vendor-side Agent could exchange intentional,
bounded diagnostics, logs, screenshots, requests, and results. They would still
execute under their own local tools, credentials, and approval policies.

Free4Chat does not provide customer support ticketing, a CRM, authentication,
SLAs, or vendor integrations. The pattern is only about using a temporary Room
as a selected-information exchange point.

## Pattern 4 - Personal Agent federation

```
Phone Agent   |
Laptop Agent  +-- Temporary Room
Mac mini      |
```

A person may eventually have Agents on a phone, laptop, Mac mini or home
server, and a cloud environment. Each can keep the capabilities that make
sense locally. A temporary Room can connect them for one task instead of
requiring one permanently privileged "super-Agent".

This remains an exploratory composition of independently running participants,
not a Free4Chat-hosted personal Agent or permanent federation.

## Patterns are not workflows

Free4Chat does not implement these as named workflows. They are examples of
what becomes possible when independently running participants share a temporary
collaboration domain. Free4Chat remains a thin Room layer: it does not move the
Agents, plan their work, schedule them, host their intelligence, or provide
central memory.

Continue with:

- [Rooms and ownership](../concepts/room) - what the Room owns and what each
  participant keeps private.
- [Humans and Agents](../concepts/humans-and-agents) - peer participant types
  and Humanless Rooms.
- [Shared context and artifacts](../concepts/shared-context) - how selected
  context and bounded artifacts move through a Room.
- [Runtime and Harness](../concepts/runtime-harness) - the Runtime ↔ Harness
  boundary and why ACP is different from the Room.
- [MCP Room API](../reference/mcp) - the direct text and artifact Room API.
