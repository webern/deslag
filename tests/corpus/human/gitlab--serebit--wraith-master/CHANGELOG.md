## Unreleased

#### Meta

- Update Kotlin to v1.6.0-M1
- Update Gradle wrapper to v7.2.0

## v1.2.0 - Brownie (2021-06-06)

#### Added

- [#3](https://gitlab.com/serebit/wraith-master/-/issues/3) - Compatibility with Alpine, Adélie, and other distributions
  that use musl! Requires gcompat to be installed for Alpine and Adélie, but otherwise works out of the box
- [#13](https://gitlab.com/serebit/wraith-master/-/issues/13) - Man pages for both GTK and CLI, hand-written and
  compiled by scdoc
- [#16](https://gitlab.com/serebit/wraith-master/-/issues/16) - Support for manually resetting the USB port
- `.metainfo.xml` file for the GTK frontend

#### Changed

- Removed `libusb_reset_device` call in initialization code. Makes initialization time 27x faster, which results in a
  10x speedup for the CLI frontend (tested on my machine, may vary by hardware)
- Version number is now inserted at build time, which means there are no scenarios in which the version number cannot be
  resolved

#### Fixed

- GTK now exits gracefully if the device is disconnected while the program is running
- Massively reduce data sent to Wraith Prism when speed and brightness are changed in GTK
- Properly specify package dependencies when building the deb file, so that apt and dpkg can check for the presence of
  these dependencies

#### Meta

- Remove most compile-time Gradle properties and add a Makefile and justfile for packaging (see
  [the wiki](https://gitlab.com/serebit/wraith-master/-/wikis/help/building-from-source) for more information)
- Change include paths for cinterop to /usr only, removing /usr/local and /opt
- Update Kotlin to v1.5.10
- Update Gradle wrapper to v7.0.2

## v1.1.2 (2021-03-16)

#### Fixed

- Use custom Konan args to remove unused binary dependencies, such as glib-2.0 and libcrypt
- Additionally remove dependency on libgcc_s

#### Meta

- Update Kotlin to v1.4.31
- Update Gradle wrapper to v6.8.3

## v1.1.1 (2021-02-06)

#### Fixed

- Update GTK's `.desktop` file with accurate categories and a TryExec field
- Error codes no longer display as `CPointer`, and instead show the proper error name
- CLI can now properly set logo and fan modes (regressed in v1.1.0)
- [#19](https://gitlab.com/serebit/wraith-master/-/issues/19) - instead of crashing on receiving an invalid mode byte,
  store the default mode internally

#### Meta

- Update Kotlin to v1.4.30
- Update Gradle wrapper to v6.8.2

## v1.1.0 (2020-08-09)

#### Added

- Firmware version reporting
- Resetting to default profile
- Toggle for Enso mode
- Focus clears on pressing the escape button

#### Changed

- More padding in GTK, since it felt a bit cramped to some people

#### Fixed

- More precise finding of `version.txt`, allowing version detection if the `installdir` is set to something other
  than `/usr` or `/usr/local`
- Clear focus on click in the About dialog box
- Prevent potentially weird behavior or crashing with better memory management
- [#10](https://gitlab.com/serebit/wraith-master/-/issues/10) - Remove "plugdev" group requirement to resolve udev error
  on Fedora

#### Meta

- Remove `taskTree` gradle plugin, as it is no longer needed
- Fix valgrind tasks
- Update Kotlin to 1.4.0-rc
- Update Gradle to 6.6-rc-6
- Add Gradle properties `forceudev`, `installmode`, and `packageroot` (see the wiki for more details on these
  properties)

## v1.0.0 (2020-05-10)

#### Added

- **Mirage frequency control**, the last major feature that required implementation
- "About" dialog in GTK, viewable by clicking the info button in the title bar
- `version` option in CLI
- Dialog box in GTK upon attempting to exit with unsaved changes

#### Changed

- Increased width of morse textbox in GTK

  are the same as the saved values
- In GTK, saved settings are restored both on app close and on app start
- In GTK, reordered component tabs to reflect Cooler Master application

#### Removed

- Brightness setting for the ring component's Morse mode is no longer available. Even though the Cooler Master
  application does show support for it, the setting doesn't affect the actual ring brightness

#### Fixed

- Reset button no longer segfaults after a few presses

#### Meta

- Update Kotlin to 1.4-M1 (retains 1.3.7x build compatibility for Solus)
- Update Gradle to 6.4
- Code cleanup in GTK and core, with a focus on reducing total LoC without sacrificing looks or functionality

- Added `strip` property to `package` Gradle task, which strips packaged binaries if enabled

## v0.5.2 (2020-03-16)

#### Fixed

- Reset button causing segfault

## v0.5.1 (2020-03-13)

#### Added

  enabled
- Reset button in GTK frontend updates widgets to the device's saved values
- Significantly reduced number of transfers to device in CLI frontend
- Significantly more checks to ensure parameter validity in CLI frontend
- Eliminated (tiny) memory leaks in setup caused by unfreed libusb resources

  colors option was selected for that mode outside of Wraith Master
- Clicking on the window now clears the keyboard focus
- Color buttons now have the correct colors set on startup for modes that don't support color

#### Meta

#### Changed

- In both frontends, restore a mode's previous settings (color, speed, brightness, etc) when that mode is selected

  the error message

  for [this issue](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native/issues/3771)

## v0.3.1 (2020-01-13)

#### Fixed

- Both frontends no longer require `sudo` to run on systems that use `systemd`

## v0.3.0 (2020-01-13)

#### Added

- Error dialog for when a Wraith Prism USB device can't be found
- Direction control for ring modes that support it
